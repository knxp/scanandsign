# Scan and Sign Project Assessment

## Background and Motivation
The Scan and Sign project is a digital signature board application that allows users to scan a QR code from a T-shirt to access a shared digital canvas where they can leave their signatures. The project aims to create an interactive and engaging way for people to sign digital boards without collecting personal data.

## Project Requirements
1. **Core Features**
   - QR code on T-shirt linking to website
   - Mobile-first design for QR code scanners
   - Signature input with color options
   - Zoomable/scrollable signature board
   - Spam prevention without personal data collection
   - Access control based on QR code scanning

2. **Technical Stack**
   - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
     - SignaturePad for signature input
     - OpenSeadragon/Panzoom for canvas
     - Mobile-friendly responsive design
   - Backend: Node.js with Express (Azure Functions)
     - POST /submit-signature endpoint
     - GET /signatures endpoint
   - Database: Azure Cosmos DB (free tier) or Table Storage
   - Hosting: Azure Static Web Apps (frontend) + Functions (backend)
   - Spam Prevention: FingerprintJS + IP tracking

3. **Cost Constraints**
   - Initial setup: Under $50
   - Monthly hosting: $0-5
   - Using Azure free tiers where possible

## Current State Assessment
1. **Project Structure**
   - Basic project structure is in place with frontend, backend, docs, and scripts directories
   - Package.json is configured with basic scripts for development and deployment
   - Frontend and backend directories are created but appear to be empty or minimal
   - Development tools (ESLint, Prettier) are configured

2. **Missing Components**
   - Frontend implementation (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files)
   - Backend Azure Functions implementation
   - Database configuration and schema
   - Azure service configurations
   - Tests and CI/CD pipeline

3. **Directory Structure Analysis**
   - Frontend/src has empty components, js, and styles directories
   - Backend/api has empty getSignatures and submitSignature directories
   - Project appears to be in initial setup phase with no implementation yet

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Technical Architecture**
   - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with SignaturePad and OpenSeadragon
   - Backend: Azure Functions (Node.js)
   - Database: Azure Cosmos DB / Table Storage
   - Hosting: Azure Static Web Apps

2. **Potential Challenges**
   - Spam prevention without user authentication
   - Real-time signature updates across multiple devices
   - Mobile responsiveness and touch interface optimization
   - Azure service integration and configuration
   - Performance optimization for large numbers of signatures
   - Access control based on QR code scanning

## Project Status Board
- [x] Initial project assessment complete
- [x] Frontend structure created
- [ ] Development environment setup (Node.js installation needed)
- [ ] Frontend development started
- [ ] Backend development started
- [ ] Testing phase
- [ ] Deployment phase

## Current Focus
1. **Frontend Development**
   - [x] Created responsive landing page
   - [x] Implemented signature input
   - [x] Set up zoomable canvas
   - [x] Mobile-friendly design
   - [ ] Node.js installation needed
   - [ ] Implement modal dialogs for user interaction
   - [ ] Add color selection for signatures
   - [ ] Design quilt-like signature board layout

2. **Local Development Setup**
   - Using SQLite for local testing
   - Will migrate to Azure Cosmos DB for production
   - NAS integration planned for future

## Next Steps
1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Install frontend dependencies
3. Start development server
4. Set up backend with SQLite for local testing
5. Create basic API endpoints for signature submission/retrieval
6. Implement modal dialogs for user interaction
7. Add color selection for signatures
8. Design quilt-like signature board layout

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
1. Node.js and npm need to be installed before proceeding
2. Frontend structure is ready but dependencies need to be installed
3. Backend development can begin after Node.js installation
4. Need to implement access control based on QR code scanning

## Lessons
1. Project structure follows standard Node.js/Azure Functions layout
2. Development tools (ESLint, Prettier) are already configured
3. Basic npm scripts are set up for development and deployment
4. Project is in very early stages with empty implementation directories
5. Using SQLite for local development before moving to production database
6. Always verify Node.js installation before starting npm commands
7. Mobile-first design is essential for QR code scanning applications
